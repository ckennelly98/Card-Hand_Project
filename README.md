# Card-Hand_Project

The Card.java file was written by my professor as starter code to the class Card, and I was to implement the methods and add the code that makes each method perform to what they are supposed to do. The methods are tested through the file CardDemo.java which was written by my professor to check the methods of the Card class to make sure my methods were correct.

The Hand.java file is an extension to the Card class, creating a new class called Hand that stores multiple Card classes in one specific Hand. Like the Card.java file, The starter code was written by my professor and I added the methods that were then tested through the HandDemo.java file that was written by my professor.
